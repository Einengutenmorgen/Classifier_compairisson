###### instructions from codebook  ##################################################################################################################################################################################################################

coding_instructions_orginal = f"""# Bottom-Up Approach to Coding - Finding the Right Code for a Quasi-
Sentence
## The Categories
The Manifesto Project developed a category system whereby each quasi-sentence of every manifesto is
coded into one, and only one, of 56 standard categories. The 56 categories are grouped into seven major
policy areas and are designed to be comparable between parties, countries, elections, and across time.
Furthermore, 12 categories are split up into 2 or more subcategories that capture specific aspects of these
categories. In these cases, the coder needs to choose between the subcategories and may not use the main
category.
## The Subcategories
Some of the categories above are further divided into two or more subcategories in order to, in particular,
accommodate the specificities of the Latin American political competition. However, these subcategories
should be used for all countries, without regard to the region the only exceptions are 305.4, 305.5 and
305.6 which are only applicable for transitional, former authoritarian regimes.
If a category has subcategories, the coder must only use the subcategories. The main
categories only remain as guidelines and for aggregation purposes, especially to enable the recreation of
the original coding scheme.
{category_scheme}
# The Code Allocation
The following questions are central to the decision making of assigning codes to quasi-sentences: What
are the statements of the party/presidential candidate? Which policy positions does the
party/presidential candidate convey? In order to make this decision, coders need to make sure that
they understand what the party/presidential candidate says. Therefore, it is essential to read every single
quasi-sentence very carefully.
Often political actors are very clear in their statements and candidly say what they seek: more of
one thing, less of another. In this case, assigning codes is straightforward: coders identify the message
and assign the corresponding category. When consulting the category scheme it is important to keep in
mind that the categories’ definitions are not exhaustive. They are meant to give a general notion and
some exemplary statements. The scopes of the categories are not constrained to the exact wording of the
definition and it should be assigned to all issues that are related to the general idea conveyed.
There are, however, times when these statements are not very clear and are more diﬃcult to code.
When facing such an ambiguous sentence, the coders should always first think about the meaning of the
quasi-sentence and double-check the quasi-sentence with all codes in the category scheme. This helps
assure that the quasi-sentence does not simply fall into one of the lesser used, ’rare’ categories.
In general, there are three possible factors which cause ambiguity: 
1) Language is often simply ambiguous. Language is full of various styles, jargon, rhetorical meanings, colloquialisms, etc. Manifestos,
therefore, often use language in manifold ways. 
2) Quite often political actors not only say what they want
to achieve but also how they want to achieve it. Sometimes, coders will find both statements within one
natural sentence and will have to decide how to handle this high density of information. 
3) Many of the political issues included in manifestos are very complex and it is not possible to convey a clear message
within one quasi-sentence. Parties and presidential candidates often choose to build their arguments over
several sentences, within a paragraph and/or sometimes even over the course of a whole chapter.
Coders need to keep these sources of ambiguity in mind in order to fully understand the message
conveyed. The following section addresses ways for coders to handle ’ambiguous’ language and other
problems during the course of coding.
## 1) Ambiguity of Language
a) Often, political actors make policy statements by mentioning a negative aspect of an issue in order
to highlight its importance. Take, for example, the following:
"Our country’s democracy does not work well enough anymore!"
This sentence could be read and interpreted as a negative statement towards the country’s democratic
processes. However, it is rather clear that the party is not making a statement against democracy itself.
The actual message of this sentence is one of concern about and criticism of the current state of democracy.
Therefore, this is a positive statement towards the ideal principle of democracy.
b) Furthermore, political actors tend to use ambiguous or convoluted language to ’hide’ certain state-
ments often deemed politically incorrect or inadmissible viewpoints. Coders should try to understand
the message while at the same time trying not to read too much into the quasi-sentence.
## 2) Ambiguity of Quasi-Sentences because of Complexity - A Hierarchy of Context
When the quasi-sentence in itself does not convey an obvious message despite coders’ best eﬀort to
find one, several levels of context might be helpful to decide how to code a quasi-sentence. These levels
are hierarchical. Coders should keep in mind that it is imperative to consider the context level closest to
the quasi-sentence first and only move to the next level in case the closer one was not helpful.
The context levels are, in sequence from the quasi-sentence level upwards:
1. the rest of the sentence in case the quasi-sentence is only part of a natural sentence
2. the previous and the following sentences
3. the whole paragraph
4. the whole chapter or section
5. the whole manifesto
6. the political discourse concerning the issue in the country at the time of the election
## 3) Statements Containing Several Messages
Sometimes more than one code seems to apply to a quasi-sentence because the party or presidential
candidate wraps several statements up into one broad statement. Quite often, these statements come in
the form of "We want to reach A by doing B and C" or "We are doing B and C because we want to reach
A." In principle, the grand rule of ’code the message’ applies. For these two examples, the message is that
A is primarily important. B and C are simply means to achieve A. Goals usually take precedence
over means when assigning codes. The following example claims that changing the constitution
might serve the purpose of promoting animal rights. Since the constitution change is clearly only a tool,
this sentence is not cut into two quasi-sentences and only the animal rights code applies.
"To make sure that animal rights are universally recognised, we are going to add them to
our constitution. (501)"
However, there are instances where this logic does not apply. It might be possible that the party not
only sends a message for A but also puts so much emphasis on B and C that B and C become messages
in themselves. This is most apparent when the quasi-sentence states that B and C are the only means
possible and there is an imperative to use them: "We want A, therefore we must employ B and C as the
only feasible options." The following example is one where the means (leaving NATO and reducing the
military) are such strong messages in themselves that they need to be coded separately from the goal
(peace).
"In order to achieve worldwide peace, (106) ◘ our country must leave NATO (105) ◘ and
reduce the military to a minimum. (105)"
## 4) Statements Containing No Message
There are instances when a sentence by itself does not make a statement. Often, the context helps
in these cases and the rules mentioned above still apply. A special case is when sentences are used as
a way to introduce or end an argument, or to connect two arguments. These introductory, terminal, or
connecting sentences do not constitute meaningful statements themselves but are part of a continuous
argument. Therefore, they should be coded in the same category as the corresponding argument or as
the bulk of the paragraph in which they appear. If they end with a colon, they should be merged with
the next quasi-sentence, often a bullet point.
## 5) Proximity of Contradicting Codes
Finally, a note of general caution: it is possible to have positive and negative codes on the same issue
right next to each other. Manifestos often include contradictory statements. Coders should not try to
assume ’hidden’ meanings in a quasi-sentence just to make sense of the sentences around it. Manifestos
are not codes to be deciphered. Instead, coders should be careful to only code what is written. The
following examples are seemingly contradictory statements in close proximity:
We will support our troops overseas, (104) ◘ while working to end the current war. (105)
Our constitution is a model for every truly democratic system (203) ◘ but we need to change
it (204).
# Specific Provisions Rules to Keep in Mind
There are several rules for the process of code allocation that stem from decades of experience with
manifesto coders. There are certain habits and behavioural patterns which all coders (and especially new
coders) should try to avoid. Therefore, while the following rules might seem trivial, coders are asked to
keep them in mind.
## Rare Occasions: When to Use the ’000’ Category
Generally, coders should try to use a meaningful code (101 to 706) whenever possible.
However, there are instances when ’000’ is an applicable code. The instances are: 1) the statement is
totally devoid of any meaning and cannot be coded within the context; 2) the statement refers to a policy
position that is not included in the category scheme. This may be particularly true for modern issues
or if the category scheme only includes codes in one direction (positive or negative) and the statement
refers to the non-included direction. For instance: environment is a positive category with no negative
counterpart. If a statement can only be classified as "Environment Negative" it should be given a ’000’
code. All quasi-sentences treated as uncodable must be rechecked after the program has been coded in
its entirety.
## Catch-All Categories
303, 305, 408 and the 700-categories (except 703, see below) are meant to be catch-all categories for
general policies that do not fit any specific coding category. They should always be avoided if a more
specific policy category can be used. However, this does not mean that they are forbidden. Coders should
double-check the usage of these categories to make sure they have not missed a specific policy.
## Agriculture
When agricultural issues are mentioned, coders often have the choice between 703 ’Agriculture and
Farmers’ and another, often economic, category. In these instances, a special rule applies: If coders can
choose between 703 or any other category, 703 should be chosen.
However, this does not mean that the inclusion of the word ’farmer’ automatically makes the category
703. This category should only be assigned if the statement is actually about agriculture and farmers in
a positive (703.1) or negative way (703.2).
## Sub-Categories from Prior Project Phases
Apart from the sub-categories introduced in chapter 4.3.2 of this handbook, a set of sub-categories had
been developed during prior phases of the Manifesto Project. These sub-categories dealt primarily with
country specific issues of Central and Eastern European countries during the post-communist transition
period. These sub-categories are still in existence, some of them have been incorporated into the category
scheme presented above. The usage of all other, country-specific sub-categories should be avoided as much
as possible.
To make sure that no sub-category is used unnecessarily, coders must contact the supervisor whenever
they consider using any of the sub-categories from prior phases that are not part of the category scheme
presented above.
## Background Knowledge vs. Personal Bias
All coders are expected to be citizens or (long-term) residents of the country they code. This is because
they benefit from their background knowledge of their country. However, background knowledge should
not be confused with a coder’s personal characteristics, beliefs, and attitudes all of which are potentially
harmful to the comparability of coding.
Background knowledge is unique knowledge that only citizens or residents of the country can have. It
includes knowledge of the country’s history, social problems and cleavages, electoral issues, party system,
and party ideology. Personal biases, on the other hand, are coders’ individual beliefs and attitudes
concerning social and political issues, party ideologies, politicians and generally concerning what is ’right’
and ’wrong’.
Coders should draw on background knowledge to help determine the code of ambiguous quasi-sentences
only. However, coders should only do so if no other clues are available. In all cases, personal bias must
be avoided! Such bias causes distortion. Coders should be especially careful when coding their most
favourite and least favourite parties!
Furthermore, coders need to make sure that the statement is coded as it reads. If a party claims that
their policy proposal has certain outcomes, this needs to be coded as it stands, even if coders think that
these policies will lead to other or even opposing results. Again, the central focus of coding is to find
out the policy positions and points of view of each party. Any personal judgements (of ’rightness’ or
’wrongness’, whether a statement is realistic or sensible, etc.) need to be avoided. The following sentence
is a good example:
"We will increase the military expenditure to ensure peace in our region. (106)"
This sentence might sound incorrect but, nevertheless, the party is conveying the message that they want
to improve the region’s prospect for peace (106)."""

fewshots=f"""# Bottom-Up Approach to Coding - Finding the Right Code for a Quasi-
Sentence
## The Categories
The Manifesto Project developed a category system whereby each quasi-sentence of every manifesto is
coded into one, and only one, of 56 standard categories. The 56 categories are grouped into seven major
policy areas and are designed to be comparable between parties, countries, elections, and across time.
Furthermore, 12 categories are split up into 2 or more subcategories that capture specific aspects of these
categories. In these cases, the coder needs to choose between the subcategories and may not use the main
category.
## The Subcategories
Some of the categories above are further divided into two or more subcategories in order to, in particular,
accommodate the specificities of the Latin American political competition. However, these subcategories
should be used for all countries, without regard to the region the only exceptions are 305.4, 305.5 and
305.6 which are only applicable for transitional, former authoritarian regimes.
If a category has subcategories, the coder must only use the subcategories. The main
categories only remain as guidelines and for aggregation purposes, especially to enable the recreation of
the original coding scheme.
# category schema
{category_scheme}

#The Code Allocation
In order to make this decision, coders need to make sure that
they understand what the party/presidential candidate says. Therefore, it is essential to read every single
quasi-sentence very carefully. Often political actors are very clear in their statements and candidly say what they seek: more of
one thing, less of another. In this case, assigning codes is straightforward: coders identify the message
and assign the corresponding category. When consulting the category scheme it is important to keep in
mind that the categories’ definitions are not exhaustive. They are meant to give a general notion and
some exemplary statements. The scopes of the categories are not constrained to the exact wording of the
definition and it should be assigned to all issues that are related to the general idea conveyed.
There are, however, times when these statements are not very clear and are more diﬃcult to code.
In general, there are three possible factors which cause ambiguity: 1) Language is often simply am-
biguous. Language is full of various styles, jargon, rhetorical meanings, colloquialisms, etc. Manifestos,
therefore, often use language in manifold ways. 2) Quite often political actors not only say what they want
to achieve but also how they want to achieve it. Sometimes, coders will find both statements within one
natural sentence and will have to decide how to handle this high density of information. 3) Many of the
political issues included in manifestos are very complex and it is not possible to convey a clear message
within one quasi-sentence. Parties and presidential candidates often choose to build their arguments over
several sentences, within a paragraph and/or sometimes even over the course of a whole chapter.
Coders need to keep these sources of ambiguity in mind in order to fully understand the message
conveyed.
## 1) Ambiguity of Language
a) Often, political actors make policy statements by mentioning a negative aspect of an issue in order
to highlight its importance
b) Furthermore, political actors tend to use ambiguous or convoluted language to ’hide’ certain state-
ments often deemed politically incorrect or inadmissible viewpoints. Coders should try to understand
the message while at the same time trying not to read too much into the quasi-sentence.
## 2) Ambiguity of Quasi-Sentences because of Complexity - A Hierarchy of Context
When the quasi-sentence in itself does not convey an obvious message despite coders’ best eﬀort to
find one, several levels of context might be helpful to decide how to code a quasi-sentence. These levels
are hierarchical. Coders should keep in mind that it is imperative to consider the context level closest to
the quasi-sentence first and only move to the next level in case the closer one was not helpful.
The context levels are, in sequence from the quasi-sentence level upwards:
1. the rest of the sentence in case the quasi-sentence is only part of a natural sentence
2. the previous and the following sentences
3. the whole paragraph
4. the whole chapter or section
5. the whole manifesto
6. the political discourse concerning the issue in the country at the time of the election
## 3) Statements Containing Several Messages
Sometimes more than one code seems to apply to a quasi-sentence because the party or presidential
candidate wraps several statements up into one broad statement. Quite often, these statements come in
the form of "We want to reach A by doing B and C" or "We are doing B and C because we want to reach
A." In principle, the grand rule of ’code the message’ applies. For these two examples, the message is that
A is primarily important. B and C are simply means to achieve A. Goals usually take precedence
over means when assigning codes.
However, there are instances where this logic does not apply. It might be possible that the party not
only sends a message for A but also puts so much emphasis on B and C that B and C become messages
in themselves.
## 4) Statements Containing No Message
There are instances when a sentence by itself does not make a statement. Often, the context helps
in these cases and the rules mentioned above still apply. A special case is when sentences are used as
a way to introduce or end an argument, or to connect two arguments. These introductory, terminal, or
connecting sentences do not constitute meaningful statements themselves but are part of a continuous
argument. Therefore, they should be coded in the same category as the corresponding argument or as
the bulk of the paragraph in which they appear. If they end with a colon, they should be merged with
the next quasi-sentence, often a bullet point.
## 5) Proximity of Contradicting Codes
Finally, a note of general caution: it is possible to have positive and negative codes on the same issue
right next to each other. Manifestos often include contradictory statements. Coders should not try to
assume ’hidden’ meanings in a quasi-sentence just to make sense of the sentences around it. Manifestos
are not codes to be deciphered. Instead, coders should be careful to only code what is written.

# Specific Provisions Rules to Keep in Mind
## Rare Occasions: When to Use the ’000’ Category
Generally, coders should try to use a meaningful code (101 to 706) whenever possible.
However, there are instances when ’000’ is an applicable code. The instances are: 1) the statement is
totally devoid of any meaning and cannot be coded within the context; 2) the statement refers to a policy
position that is not included in the category scheme. This may be particularly true for modern issues
or if the category scheme only includes codes in one direction (positive or negative) and the statement
refers to the non-included direction. For instance: environment is a positive category with no negative
counterpart. If a statement can only be classified as "Environment Negative" it should be given a ’000’
code. All quasi-sentences treated as uncodable must be rechecked after the program has been coded in
its entirety.
## Catch-All Categories
303, 305, 408 and the 700-categories (except 703, see below) are meant to be catch-all categories for
general policies that do not fit any specific coding category. They should always be avoided if a more
specific policy category can be used. However, this does not mean that they are forbidden. Coders should

There are, however, times when these statements are not very clear and are more diﬃcult to code.
When facing such an ambiguous sentence, the coders should always first think about the meaning of the
quasi-sentence and double-check the quasi-sentence with all codes in the category scheme. This helps
assure that the quasi-sentence does not simply fall into one of the lesser used, ’rare’ categories.
In general, there are three possible factors which cause ambiguity: 1) Language is often simply am-
biguous. Language is full of various styles, jargon, rhetorical meanings, colloquialisms, etc. Manifestos,

## Ambiguity of Language

A." In principle, the grand rule of ’code the message’ applies. For these two examples, the message is that
A is primarily important. B and C are simply means to achieve A. Goals usually take precedence
over means when assigning codes. The following example claims that changing the constitution
might serve the purpose of promoting animal rights. Since the constitution change is clearly only a tool,
this sentence is not cut into two quasi-sentences and only the animal rights code applies.
"To make sure that animal rights are universally recognised, we are going to add them to
our constitution. (501)"
However, there are instances where this logic does not apply. It might be possible that the party not
only sends a message for A but also puts so much emphasis on B and C that B and C become messages
in themselves. This is most apparent when the quasi-sentence states that B and C are the only means
possible and there is an imperative to use them: "We want A, therefore we must employ B and C as the
only feasible options." The following example is one where the means (leaving NATO and reducing the
military) are such strong messages in themselves that they need to be coded separately from the goal
(peace).
"In order to achieve worldwide peace, (106) ◘ our country must leave NATO (105) ◘ and
reduce the military to a minimum. (105)"
4) Statements Containing No Message

following examples are seemingly contradictory statements in close proximity:
We will support our troops overseas, (104) ◘ while working to end the current war. (105)

it (204).

These sub-categories are still in existence, some of them have been incorporated into the category scheme presented above. The usage of all other, country-specific sub-categories should be avoided as much
as possible.
To make sure that no sub-category is used unnecessarily, coders must contact the supervisor whenever
they consider using any of the sub-categories from prior phases that are not part of the category scheme
presented above.
## Background Knowledge vs. Personal Bias
harmful to the comparability of coding.
All coders are expected to be citizens or (long-term) residents of the country they code. This is because they benefit from their background knowledge of their country. However, background knowledge should not be confused with a coder’s personal characteristics, beliefs, and attitudes all of which are potentially. Background knowledge is unique knowledge that only citizens or residents of the country can have. It includes knowledge of the country’s history, social problems and cleavages, electoral issues, party system, and party ideology. Personal biases, on the other hand, are coders’ individual beliefs and attitudes concerning social and political issues, party ideologies, politicians and generally concerning what is ’right’ and ’wrong’.
Coders should draw on background knowledge to help determine the code of ambiguous quasi-sentences
only. However, coders should only do so if no other clues are available. In all cases, personal bias must be avoided! Such bias causes distortion. Coders should be especially careful when coding their most favourite and least favourite parties!
Furthermore, coders need to make sure that the statement is coded as it reads. If a party claims that their policy proposal has certain outcomes, this needs to be coded as it stands, even if coders think that these policies will lead to other or even opposing results. Again, the central focus of coding is to find out the policy positions and points of view of each party. Any personal judgements (of ’rightness’ or ’wrongness’, whether a statement is realistic or sensible, etc.) need to be avoided. """
